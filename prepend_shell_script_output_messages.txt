When running one shell script from another, it may be useful
to prepend the output messages written to the command window
from the child script with something (e.g. the name of the 
script that was called). To do so, tack on this pipe to the
end of the command that calls the child script.

| while read line; do echo "[INSERT TEXT HERE] $line"; done

For example:
sh some_script.sh | while read line; do echo "[some_script.sh] $line"; done
